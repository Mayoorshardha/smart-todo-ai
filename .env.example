# Environment Variables for Smart Todo AI

# Optional: Override API endpoint
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-custom-api.com/claude

# For local development, the app uses:
# - Development: http://localhost:3001/api/claude (local server)
# - Production: /api/claude (Vercel serverless function)

# Note: Claude API keys are entered in the app interface, not here
# This keeps them secure and allows users to use their own keys
